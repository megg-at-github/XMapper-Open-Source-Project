#XMapper - Networking Tool


XMapper is a powerful and user-friendly networking tool developed in Python, designed to provide detailed network information and perform speed tests. With its simple yet comprehensive functionality, XMapper is an indispensable tool for network administrators, developers, and anyone interested in analyzing and optimizing network performance.


Using XMapper is straightforward. Simply run the Python script, and it will initiate the process of retrieving network details and conducting speed tests. The tool leverages the wmi, socket, and speedtest libraries to perform its operations effectively.


Upon execution, XMapper retrieves essential network details such as IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers. This information is invaluable for troubleshooting network issues, optimizing network configurations, or simply understanding the network setup.


Additionally, XMapper measures network speeds using the speedtest library. By performing download and upload speed tests, it provides accurate insights into the network's performance. These measurements can prove crucial in identifying potential bottlenecks, optimizing bandwidth allocation, or evaluating the effectiveness of network improvements.


XMapper also incorporates the socket library to obtain the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table output. This allows the tool to extract IP and MAC addresses, providing a comprehensive view of the devices connected to the local network.


Privacy is of utmost importance when using any networking tool. XMapper is designed to prioritize user privacy and data security. It does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. The tool only retrieves network-related information that is essential for analysis and troubleshooting purposes. No data is sent over the internet or shared with any external entities.


To further enhance privacy and security, it is recommended to run XMapper on a trusted and secure system. Regularly updating the tool and its dependencies helps ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.


In conclusion, XMapper is a versatile networking tool that provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for retrieving network details, performing speed tests, and extracting IP and MAC addresses. Its user-friendly interface and emphasis on privacy make it an invaluable companion for network administrators, developers, and anyone seeking to optimize and understand network performance.
